JavaScript Slot Machine

A fun little slot machine game I made to play around with randomness, game logic, and a vibe that feels like me. You start with $2500, choose your bet ($20, $50, or $100), and spin the reels. If all three match, you win big. If notâ€”reset and spin again. Afro picks, sweet potato pie, gold grillzâ€”itâ€™s giving culture.

How It's Made:

Tech Used:

HTML

JavaScript

All built with vanilla JavaScript. No CSS yetâ€”just focused on the logic. I used Math.random() to shuffle the emoji-style images and addEventListener for handling spins and bets. Players pick a bet amount, spin the reels, and if all three match, they get 10x their bet. If not, they lose that amount. There's also a reset button to start over anytime.

Optimizations:

Hereâ€™s what I might add next:

Some animated spins to make it feel more alive

A lil' soundtrack or win sound

A tracker for wins/losses

Clean up image loading for smoother gameplay

Lessons Learned:

This gave me a chance to get more comfortable managing game state, writing clean conditionals, and creating user feedback with alerts and messages. Also reminded me that projects donâ€™t need to be huge to be impactfulâ€”or fun.
